# Simple-Maze-game-in-C-using-Graphics.h-Library

Software Support: Code Blocks (Newest Version Recommended)
                  
Points: 1. You may not have graphics.h library (Code Blocks doesn't have this library in their basic package). So you have to follow a                couple of steps to get the library. 
        2. Download the file named "Graphics Library" and follow the instructions of the 'read me' file in it.
