# Simple-Maze-game-in-C-using-Graphics.h-Library

Software Support: Code Blocks (Newest Version Recommended)
                  
Points: 1. You may not have graphics.h library (Code Blocks doesn't have this library in their basic package). So you have to follow a                couple of steps to get the library. 
        2. Download the file named "Graphics Library" and follow the instructions of the 'info' txt file in it. 
        3. After doing everything acconding to the info.txt file, your Code Blocks will be able to support the graphics.h library.
        4. Then just use the rest of the files as like as you use to run a code in Code Blocks. 

That's It.
